# Decreasing increments of a concave function

A concave function's increment over an interval of fixed length shrinks as the interval
slides right. In economics this is the increasing-differences (supermodularity) condition
that monotone-comparative-statics arguments run on, usually stated as a cross partial
`-u'' > 0`. Stated this way it needs no derivatives and no smoothness at all.

The proof is two applications of concavity. Writing `L = (c₂ + Δ) - c₁`, the two interior
points `c₁ + Δ` and `c₂` are *complementary* convex combinations of the endpoints `c₁` and
`c₂ + Δ`: the weights on `c₂ + Δ` are `Δ / L` and `(c₂ - c₁) / L`, which sum to one. Adding
the two concavity inequalities makes the weights cancel.

/-! ### Lipschitz away from the left endpoint

A concave function on `Ioi 0` need not be Lipschitz there -- utility functions used in
economics are exactly the ones that are not, diverging at zero -- but it IS Lipschitz on
`[δ, ∞)` for any `δ > 0`, with a constant read off a single secant. No differentiability is
needed: the bound comes from antitonicity of secant slopes.

This is what lets a marginal argument be run without a derivative. Where the textbook
argument bounds the marginal utility of consumption by `u'(δ)`, this bounds it by the slope
of `u` across `[δ/2, δ]`, which is available from concavity alone. -/

/-! ### Scaling a concave function

For a concave, strictly positive `z`, the ratio `α / z (α x)` rises with `α`. This is Lemma 3
of Light (2018), one of the three ingredients of his Theorem 1 (savings rise with the interest
rate when relative risk aversion is at most one).

Like the increments lemma above, it needs no derivative: `α₁ x` is a convex combination of `0`
and `α₂ x` with weight `α₁ / α₂`, so concavity gives the inequality directly, and strict
positivity at the origin is what turns it from weak into the stated form.
