# HARA utility

Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion: absolute risk tolerance `-u' / u''` is affine in consumption.
Toda (2021) shows HARA is NECESSARY for the consumption function to be concave under regularity
conditions, so it is the class in which Carroll and Kimball (1996) -- and hence Light's
uniqueness argument -- can possibly hold.

## The definition

Stating "risk tolerance is affine" needs second derivatives. Since risk tolerance `a + c` scaled
by `1/γ` integrates to a shifted CRRA, the family can instead be given by its members, which is
derivative-free and is what every proof below actually uses:

  `u c = k · (a + c) ^ (1 - γ) / (1 - γ) + l`,  and the `γ = 1` logarithm,

with `k > 0`. This is the `b ≠ 0` branch of HARA -- the one that contains CRRA, and the one
macroeconomics uses. The quadratic branch (`b < 0`) is excluded because it satiates, and that
exclusion is now a theorem rather than a remark: `Models.Quadratic.no_incomeFluctuation_quadUtility`
shows no economy in this development can have quadratic utility, for any bliss point, since the
structure asks for monotone utility on the whole of `dom` and a quadratic falls beyond its bliss
point. `Models.Quadratic` also records what the branch would give if it could be hosted — Hall's
certainty equivalence, the aggregator being the plain weighted mean.

CARA (`b = 0`) is NOT excluded, and an earlier version of this docstring was wrong about why it
might be: `u c = -exp (-α c) / α` is bounded above by `0` and equals `-1/α` at zero consumption,
so a capped model admits it -- `Models.IncomeFluctuationCARA.caraWitness` is one. What CARA does
not have is Light's condition, since relative risk aversion `α c` is unbounded
(`not_monotoneOn_mul_deriv_caraUtility`). It is covered separately because its Carroll--Kimball
step needs a different aggregator, the soft minimum of `Analysis.SoftMin` rather than a power
mean; see `Models.IncomeFluctuationCARA`.

The shift `a` is the subsistence level of Stone and Geary. `a = 0` is CRRA exactly.

## The result that matters

`relativeRiskAversionLeOne_haraUtility`: HARA with a NONNEGATIVE shift and `γ ≤ 1` satisfies
Light's condition. Relative risk aversion of the shifted family is `γ c / (a + c)`, which for
`a ≥ 0` is at most `γ`; a negative shift (genuine subsistence) pushes it above `γ` and can break
the condition however small `γ` is, so the sign of the shift is not a technicality.

The proof is derivative-free in the sense that matters: it factors

  `c · u' c = c ^ (1 - γ) · (c / (a + c)) ^ γ`

into two nonnegative nondecreasing factors, which is exactly `u' c · c` nondecreasing, which is
relative risk aversion at most one.
