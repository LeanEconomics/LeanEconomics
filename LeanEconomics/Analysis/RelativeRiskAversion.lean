# Relative risk aversion at most one

Light (2018) proves that individual saving rises with the interest rate — his Theorem 1, the
household half of the uniqueness argument — under the assumption that `u'(c) · c` is
non-decreasing. With `u' > 0` that is exactly relative risk aversion `-c u''/u' ≤ 1`, because

  `d/dc [c u'(c)] = u'(c) · (1 - RRA(c))`.

Economically it is the condition under which the substitution effect of a higher interest rate
dominates the income effect. It is the boundary of the region where the model is known to have
a unique equilibrium: Açıkgöz (2018) exhibits multiplicity at `γ = 6.5`, and Walsh and Young
(2025) report never seeing multiplicity below about `γ = 1.49`.

## Stating it without derivatives

`u'(c) · c` is the derivative of `t ↦ u(eᵗ)`, so the assumption says precisely that **`u` is
convex as a function of log consumption**, and that is how it is defined here. The definition
needs no differentiability, and neither does its main consequence: increments of `u` across a
fixed PROPORTIONAL change in consumption grow as consumption grows,

  `u(α c₁) - u(c₁) ≤ u(α c₂) - u(c₂)`  for `0 < c₁ ≤ c₂` and `α ≥ 1`,

which is `sub_le_sub_of_scale` below. This is the multiplicative twin of
`ConcaveOn.sub_le_sub_of_shift`, and it is the form the comparative-statics argument uses, since
a change in the interest rate scales the return on saving rather than shifting it.

Where derivatives are available the two formulations agree, and `relativeRiskAversionLeOne_iff`
proves that. The examples at the end pin the boundary down: CRRA satisfies the condition exactly
when `γ ≤ 1`, log utility sits on the boundary (convex in log consumption because it is AFFINE
there), and for `γ > 1` it fails — indeed `u ∘ exp` is then strictly concave, so the condition
fails as badly as it can.

/-! ### The step of Light's Theorem 1 that all of this serves

Light's Theorem 1 compares a household facing gross return `α₁` with one facing `α₂ ≥ α₁`, and
its pivotal inequality is that the marginal value of wealth, `α · u'(c)`, is larger at the
higher return. Written out, `α u'(c) = (α / c) · (u'(c) · c)`, and the two factors are exactly
the two conditions: `α / c(α x)` rises with `α` because the consumption function is CONCAVE
(Lemma 3, `ConcaveOn.div_le_div_of_scale`), and `u'(c) c` rises with `c` because relative risk
aversion is at most one. Neither factor alone signs the product; splitting it this way is the
whole trick.

Note what the consumption function has to supply: concavity, positivity at zero assets, and
monotonicity. The first is Light's Lemma 4 and is the deep one — he cites Jensen (2017), and it
is a Carroll–Kimball result that needs more than concavity of `u` and of the value function.
-/

/-- **The pivotal inequality of Light (2018) Theorem 1.** For a concave, positive, increasing
consumption function `c` and marginal utility `du` with relative risk aversion at most one, the

/-! ### Beyond relative risk aversion one

For `u'(c) = c^{-γ}` with `γ > 1`, `c · u'(c) = c^{1-γ}` FALLS, so the second factor above goes
the wrong way — but only by the factor `(c(α₂x)/c(α₁x))^{γ-1}`, and the first factor bounds that
ratio: concavity through a positive value at zero gives the chord bound
`c(α₂x)/c(α₁x) ≤ 1 + (1 - c(0)/c(α₁x))(α₂/α₁ - 1)`. So the pivotal inequality survives wherever

  `(1 - c(0)/c(α₁x)) · (ρ - 1) ≤ ρ^{1/γ} - 1`,   `ρ = α₂/α₁`,

which for returns close together says consumption at `α₁x` is at most about `γ/(γ-1)` times
consumption at zero assets. For `γ ≤ 1` the condition is automatic, since `ρ^{1/γ} ≥ ρ`;
for `γ > 1` it is a restriction on the RANGE of the consumption function, not on the utility. -/
