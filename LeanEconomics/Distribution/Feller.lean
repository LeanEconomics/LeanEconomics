# The agent distribution: state space and Markov operator

Step one towards a stationary agent distribution for the income fluctuation problem.

## The compact state space

The model is posed with state space `ℝ × Z`, but a distribution has to live somewhere
compact -- Prokhorov's theorem, which supplies the compactness of the space of probability
measures, needs a compact underlying space. The household never leaves
`[0, assetCap] × Z`, so that is where the distribution lives, and `State` is that region as
a space in its own right rather than as a subset of a larger one.

Taking it as a subtype is forced. A *subset* of `ℝ × Z` would not be a compact space, and
the earlier concavity work could not use a subtype because it is not a module over `ℝ`.
Both choices are right in their own place: concavity needs the linear structure of the
ambient space, the distribution needs compactness of the region.

## The Markov operator

`markovOp h s` is the expected value of `h` at next period's state, given that the household
is at `s` today and follows its optimal policy. The content of the definition is that it
lands in the *bounded continuous* functions again:

* continuity is the **Feller property**, and comes from continuity of the optimal policy,
  which is what the whole concavity and uniqueness development was for;
* boundedness is immediate from `∑ prob = 1`.

Feller is what will make the induced map on probability measures continuous, and continuity
of that map is what a fixed point argument needs.

## The operator on measures

`push μ` is where the distribution `μ` is a period later. It is assembled from
`Measure.withDensity` and `Measure.map` rather than from `Measure.bind`: Mathlib has
`lintegral_bind` but no Bochner `integral_bind`, whereas both of the former have their
Bochner lemmas, and it is the Bochner integral that the weak topology is stated with.

`integral_push` is the duality `∫ h d(push μ) = ∫ (markovOp h) dμ`, and it is what makes
the whole thing work: weak convergence is tested against bounded continuous functions, so
weak continuity of `push` reduces immediately to `markovOp h` being one.
