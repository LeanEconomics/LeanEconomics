# Aiyagari stationary equilibrium

An interest rate at which the capital households choose to hold equals the capital firms
want to employ.

Aggregation is the easy half and is done here in full: mean assets under the agent
distribution is the integral of the asset coordinate, which is a BOUNDED CONTINUOUS function
on the compact state space, so aggregate capital is weakly continuous in the distribution.
That is the one place the compactness of the state space pays off directly, and it means no
separate uniform-integrability argument is needed.

The firm side is left abstract: any continuous capital demand schedule `D` will do, so a
Cobb-Douglas firm with depreciation is one instance among many, and nothing here depends on
which.

What is assumed rather than proved is that capital supply moves continuously with the
interest rate. That is the remaining gap, and it is a real one -- see the note at the end of
this file.

/-- **Existence of an Aiyagari stationary equilibrium.**

Given a capital supply schedule `S` that is realised by a stationary distribution at every
interest rate and is continuous, and any continuous capital demand schedule `D`, a rate at
which the two agree exists as soon as excess demand changes sign across the interval.

Uniqueness of the stationary distribution is what makes `S` a FUNCTION of `r` rather than a
correspondence, and that is what allows the intermediate value theorem to close the argument
in place of a fixed point theorem for correspondences -- Mathlib has no Kakutani. -/

## What remains

`exists_aiyagari_equilibrium` takes continuity of capital supply `S` as a hypothesis. The
pieces already proved discharge part of it and identify exactly what is missing.

Given a family of household problems indexed by the interest rate:

1. `continuousAt_fixedPoint` (in `DynamicProgramming/Parametric.lean`) reduces continuity of
   `r ↦ valueFunction r` to continuity of `r ↦ bellman r v₀` at the SINGLE function
   `v₀ = valueFunction r₀`, in sup norm. The Blackwell contraction modulus is the discount
   factor, which does not vary with `r`, so the common-modulus hypothesis is free.
2. From a continuous value function, continuity of the policy in `r` would follow by the same
   Berge argument that already gives continuity in the state, since the maximiser is unique.
3. From a continuous policy, `r ↦ push r` is weakly continuous, so the set of stationary
   distributions has closed graph; with UNIQUENESS (`stationary_unique_of_exhausts`) a
   convergent subnet argument on the compact space of probability measures gives continuity
   of `r ↦ μ r`.
4. `continuous_aggregateCapital` then gives continuity of `S`, since the asset coordinate is
   bounded and continuous. This step is proved.

Step 1 is the substantial one: it needs a sup-norm (not pointwise) estimate, uniform over the
state space, and the extended-real reward makes it delicate near zero consumption, where
utility falls to `-∞`. The estimate is true -- the optimum keeps consumption bounded away
from zero because the value is finite -- but proving it uniformly in `r` is real work.

A second obstacle is structural rather than mathematical: `assetCap` is a FIELD of
`IncomeFluctuation`, so `(Pf r).State` is a different type for each `r`. Any statement
quantifying over the family across rates has to either fix the cap across the family or carry
transports. That is why the theorem above quantifies the distribution inside an existential,
where the dependence causes no trouble.
