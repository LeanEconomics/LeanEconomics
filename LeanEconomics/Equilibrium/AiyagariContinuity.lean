# Capital supply is continuous, and the equilibrium theorem applies

`exists_aiyagari_equilibrium` has carried one hypothesis since it was proved: that capital
supply moves continuously with the interest rate. This file discharges it.

Aggregation turns out not to depend on the rate at all -- the asset coordinate is the asset
coordinate whatever the rate, and `aggregateCapital` is equal across rates by `rfl` -- so all
the rate dependence sits in the stationary distribution, and `tendsto_stationary` supplies it.
Capital supply is then a continuous function composed with a convergent selection.

The family is indexed by the CLAMPED rate, so that a household problem is defined at every
real number while agreeing with the intended one on `[rlo, rhi]`. Without that the family
would need a proof of `0 < 1 + r` at every real `r`, which is false.

/-- **An Aiyagari stationary equilibrium exists**, with nothing assumed about the household
side beyond a selection of stationary distributions that is unique at each rate.

Compared with `exists_aiyagari_equilibrium`, the continuity of capital supply is no longer a
hypothesis: it is proved, from continuity of the policy in the rate and weak continuity of
aggregation. What remains assumed is the firm side -- any continuous demand schedule -- and
that excess demand changes sign, which is where the economics of the calibration enters. -/
