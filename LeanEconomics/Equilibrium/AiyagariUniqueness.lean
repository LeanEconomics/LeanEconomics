# Uniqueness of the equilibrium rate for a log economy at large `β`

The chain of Light (2018) — individual saving rises with the rate (Theorem 1), so aggregate
saving does (Theorem 2), so it meets a strictly decreasing demand once (Theorem 3) — assembled
for LOG utility with the constants that survive `β = 0.96`.

## The normalised firm

Aiyagari's firm is Cobb--Douglas with capital share `α`: `k(r) = (α/(r+δ))^(1/(1-α))` and
`w(r) = (1-α) k(r)^α`. Light's Theorem 3 works with the ratio, and the ratio needs no root:

  `k(r) / w(r) = α / ((1-α)(r+δ))`,

strictly decreasing in `r`. Capital supply is homogeneous of degree one in the wage (Açıkgöz
Proposition 7, `Equilibrium/Homothetic`), so Aiyagari's steady-state condition `K(r) = Ea(r)` at
wage `w(r)` is the condition `k(r)/w(r) = Ea₁(r)` for the unit-wage economy. This file proves
that the latter has at most one solution.

## What is assumed of the income process

That its transitions are MONOTONE — a higher-income state's row first-order stochastically
dominates a lower one's (`MonotoneTransitions`; iid is the trivial case) — and that the worst
state has income `minIncome` and is reachable from everywhere. Nothing else: no transition
probabilities are named. That is why the theorem can be stated for Aiyagari's calibration
without reproducing his seven-state Tauchen chains: a Tauchen discretisation of an AR(1) with
positive persistence has monotone transitions by construction, so at `μ = 1` every column of his
Table II is covered, `ρ = 0` and `ρ > 0` alike.

## What is assumed of the cap

One inequality, `2β · maxIncome < (1 - β(1+rhi)) · cap`. The asset cap is bookkeeping imposed for
compactness; this says it was set large enough not to bind, and it is the only place the cap
enters.

`β = 0.96`, `α = 0.36`, `δ = 0.08`, log utility, no borrowing, and an iid labour endowment
process about which nothing else is assumed. The time-preference rate is `λ = 1/0.96 - 1 = 1/24`,
and the theorem covers every interval `[0, rhi]` with `rhi < 1/24`; his reported equilibrium
rates at `μ = 1` lie between `3.3%` and `4.17%`, all inside. -/

/-- **Aiyagari (1994) at `μ = 1`: the equilibrium interest rate is unique** on `[0, rhi]` for
every `rhi` below the time-preference rate `1/24`, for any economy with his preferences and
technology and any earnings process with monotone transitions, provided the asset cap clears
`(48/25) · maxIncome / (1 - (24/25)(1+rhi))`. -/
