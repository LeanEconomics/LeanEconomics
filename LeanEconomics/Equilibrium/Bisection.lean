# Bisection finds the equilibrium rate, and the log Aiyagari instance

Aiyagari (1994) computed his equilibrium by bisection on the interest rate: evaluate excess
supply at the midpoint of a bracket and keep the half on which it still changes sign. Hajek and
Livesay (2019) ask, for mean field games, which equilibria are STABLE fixed points of the
best-response map; for the Bewley model the raw best-response iteration `r ↦ r_d(K_s(r))` has
negative slope and may oscillate, so the algorithm that is certified here is the bisection.

## The abstract statement

`bisect f a b n` is the bracket after `n` steps. If `f` is STRICTLY MONOTONE on `[a, b]` and
vanishes at `r ∈ [a, b]`, then every bracket contains `r` (`bisect_mem_of_strictMonoOn`), the
width halves each step (`bisect_width`), and the endpoints converge to `r`
(`tendsto_bisect_fst`). No continuity and no sign condition at the ends are used: strict
monotonicity alone decides which half the zero is in. The midpoint after `n` steps is within
`(b - a)/2^(n+1)` of `r` (`abs_bisect_mid_sub_le`).

## The instance

For Aiyagari's log calibration the supply schedule along any selection of stationary
distributions is monotone (`log_monotoneOn_capitalSupply`) and Cobb--Douglas demand is strictly
decreasing, so excess supply is strictly increasing. `aiyagari1994_log_bisection` therefore says:
whatever equilibrium rate there is on `[rlo, rhi] ⊂ (-δ, λ)`, the bisection on excess supply
brackets it at every step and converges to it — the numerical procedure is certified to find the
rate that `aiyagari1994_log_equilibriumRate_unique` says is the only one.
