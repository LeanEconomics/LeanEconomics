# Light (2018) Theorem 2: aggregate savings rise with the interest rate

`Equilibrium.Uniqueness` proves single crossing — Light's Theorem 3 — but carries MONOTONE
CAPITAL SUPPLY as a hypothesis, with nothing in the development connecting that hypothesis to
the household side. This file supplies the connection. Given that every household saves more at
the higher rate, aggregate capital is larger there, so the hypothesis of `equilibriumRate_unique`
follows from the conclusion of Light's Theorem 1.

That leaves the whole uniqueness argument resting on one thing: Theorem 1, itself reduced to the
Carroll and Kimball step in `IncomeFluctuationCarrollKimball`.

## The argument

Aggregate capital is mean assets under the stationary distribution, so what has to be compared
is two distributions, not two numbers. The comparison is first-order stochastic dominance in the
asset coordinate, `Dominates`, tested against bounded continuous functions that rise with assets
at each income state.

Three facts do the work, and they are the three things a dominance argument always needs.

* The Markov operator PRESERVES the test class: `markovOp` of a function rising in assets rises
  in assets, because the policy does (`policy_mono`). Note where the income chain enters — it
  does not. The probabilities depend on today's income state alone, so comparing two asset
  levels at a FIXED income state leaves them untouched.
* A uniformly larger policy gives a larger operator, on the test class.
* Dominance survives weak limits, since the test functions are bounded and continuous.

Then run both economies forward from the SAME initial distribution. They stay ordered at every
date by the first two facts, and each converges to its own stationary distribution by
`tendsto_pushProb_iterate` — the Doeblin convergence proved for step 4 of the roadmap, which has
had no consumer until now. The third fact passes the order to the limit.

The Doeblin data appears as hypotheses at both rates. It is the same minorisation the uniqueness
theorem runs on: an atom at the borrowing constraint.
