# The firm side

`exists_aiyagari_equilibrium` takes any continuous capital demand schedule. This file supplies
one that is DERIVED from a production function rather than posited, so the equilibrium theorem
becomes a statement about a model rather than about a schedule.

The technology is Cobb–Douglas with `α = 1/2`, one unit of labour and total factor
productivity `A`, so output is `A √K` and the marginal product of capital is `A / (2√K)`.
Setting the net marginal product equal to the interest rate,

  A / (2√K) - δ = r,

and solving gives `K = A² / (4(r+δ)²)`. `capitalDemand_marginalProduct` checks that the
solution really does satisfy the first-order condition, which is what stops the formula from
being an arbitrary decreasing function with a suggestive name.

Productivity is a PARAMETER rather than fixed at one because the demand schedule otherwise
carries a scale the household side has to be stretched to meet. `exists_firm_of_bounds` is what
that buys: given any rate interval and any two-sided bound on capital supply, some firm meets it
there. The firm can be calibrated to the households rather than the other way round.

`α = 1/2` is chosen so the inversion is algebraic. A general exponent would need `rpow` and
would change nothing conceptually.

## What this does and does not close

Equilibrium needs excess demand to change sign across `[rlo, rhi]`. The LOW end is now a
theorem: capital demand diverges as `r` approaches `-δ`, while capital supply can never exceed
the asset cap, so `capitalDemand δ rlo ≥ assetCap ≥ S rlo` for `rlo` close enough to `-δ`.

The HIGH end is not, and the obstruction is economic rather than technical. It needs
`capitalDemand δ rhi ≤ S rhi`, and since Cobb–Douglas demand is strictly positive that forces
`S rhi > 0` -- households must hold capital at high interest rates. That is obvious
economically and unproved here. Worse, it is in tension with the only calibration whose
Doeblin hypotheses are verified: the impatient household of `NonVacuity` is driven to the
borrowing constraint at EVERY asset level, so its stationary distribution sits at zero assets
and its capital supply is identically zero. A calibration with a genuine equilibrium needs the
constraint to bind at the bad income state but not the good one, which the uniform corner
condition of `policy_eq_zero_of_corner` cannot express.

/-! ### The implied rate

Equilibrium is often stated the other way round: a rate `r` induces a capital stock, the capital
stock induces a marginal product, and equilibrium is where the induced rate returns `r`. That is
the same condition — `impliedRate` inverts `capitalDemand` — and `capitalDemand_eq_iff` says so. -/
