# Aggregate capital is strictly positive

Every equilibrium result so far is conditional on excess demand changing sign, and nothing in
the development says that households save anything at all. This file supplies the missing
economics: under log utility, households rich enough in income save strictly, and the stationary
distribution then carries strictly positive aggregate capital.

## Capital is the mean of the policy

`markovOp_assetCoord` is the identity the whole argument runs on. The expected asset coordinate
next period is the policy today, because the asset the household carries forward does not depend
on which income shock arrives:

  `markovOp assetCoord = policyCoord`.

With stationarity that gives `aggregateCapital μ = ∫ policy dμ` — aggregate capital is the mean
saving, not merely something computed from the distribution. Everything after is a lower bound
on that integral.

## Rich households save, and the argument is the crudest deviation again

Saving `h` rather than nothing costs `u resources - u (resources - h)` and gains
`β (cont h - cont 0)`. For LOG the cost is `log (m / (m - h))`, which SHRINKS as resources grow,
while the gain is a fixed positive number — positive because the value function is strictly
increasing in assets, which `valueFunction_lt_of_lt` proves from strict monotonicity of `u`,
itself recovered from strict concavity. So above an explicit income level the household saves
strictly, with no envelope theorem and no Euler equation.

Since the cost falls with resources, it is enough to check the inequality at the household's
POOREST state in that income, `a = 0`, and it then holds at every asset level.

## Reaching those households

The income coordinate of the stationary distribution is bounded below by the worst transition
probability into that state, and that too is pure duality: the indicator of an income state is
CONTINUOUS here, `Z` being discrete, so it is a legitimate test function and
`markovOp (incomeIndicator z₁) s = transitionMatrix s.2 z₁`. Stationarity turns a uniform lower
bound on the column of the transition matrix into a lower bound on the mass.

/-! ### The gain, bounded by primitives

`policy_pos_of_income` asks for a lower bound on `cont z₁ h - cont z₁ 0`, which is an object of
the solved model rather than a primitive. It is bounded below by the same deviation trick applied
one level down, and WHICH TERM OF THE SUM IS KEPT is the economics.

Bounding by the worst state — every `income z'` replaced by `maxIncome` — gives, for small `h`, a
condition amounting to `β (1 + r) > 1`. That is useless here: the natural asset bound wants
`β (1 + r) < 1`, so the two would collide. Keeping the LOW-income term instead gives
`P z z₀ · log (1 + (1+r) h / income z₀)`, and with `income z₀` small that term is large; the
condition becomes roughly `β (1 + r) · P z z₀ > minIncome / maxIncome`, satisfiable under ordinary
impatience provided income is dispersed.

That difference is the precautionary motive. The household saves not because it is patient but
because with probability `P z z₀` it lands where consumption is small and the marginal value of
assets is large. The motive enters through the DISPERSION of income rather than through convexity
of `u'`, which is why it is available without a third derivative. -/
