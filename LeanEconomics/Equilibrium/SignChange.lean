# The sign change, both ends

`Equilibrium.Firm` proved the LOW end of the sign change — capital demand diverges as the rate
approaches `-δ`, while capital supply can never exceed the asset cap — and recorded that the HIGH
end was open, needing `capitalDemand δ rhi ≤ S rhi` and hence `S rhi > 0`, which it called
"obvious economically and unproved here".

That is now proved. `PositiveCapital` gives strictly positive capital supply, and what remains is
to make the bound QUANTITATIVE: the sign change needs a number, not merely positivity, because
`rhi` has to be chosen from it. `le_aggregateCapital` supplies the number from a uniform lower
bound on saving, and `exists_capitalDemand_le` is the mirror of `exists_capitalDemand_ge` —
Cobb–Douglas demand vanishes at high rates, so any positive supply floor is eventually met.

`exists_sign_change` then brackets the equilibrium from two-sided bounds on capital supply, and
`exists_equilibrium_of_bounds` hands the bracket to `exists_aiyagari_equilibrium`.

## What is still assumed, and it is no longer the demand side

The bounds `m ≤ S r ≤ M` are required at every rate. The upper one is free, from
`aggregateCapital_le`.
The lower one is the live hypothesis: `PositiveCapital` proves it at a rate, and making it uniform
over an interval wide enough for the curves to cross is what the crude constants make hard — the
decline condition alone needs `ε > r/(1+r)`, and with `ε ≈ 0.27` that caps the interval near
`r = 0.37`. So the remaining obstruction is a QUANTITATIVE one about the household side, not a
structural gap in the equilibrium argument.

/-- **The firm can be calibrated to the households**, rather than the other way round. Given any
rate interval and any two-sided bound on capital supply, some productivity and depreciation put
capital demand above supply at the low end and below it at the high end.

This is what the productivity parameter buys. With `A` fixed at one the demand schedule carries a
scale of its own, and the household economy has to be stretched — in practice to absurd
depreciation rates — for the curves to meet. Here `A` sets the scale and `δ` the curvature, and
the construction is explicit: `η = d √m / (√M + √m)` with `d = rhi - rlo`, then `δ = η - rlo` and
`A = 2 η √M`, at which the low end holds with EQUALITY. -/

/-! ### The equilibrium, from uniqueness and a floor

Everything the equilibrium theorem wants is now available on the household side: uniqueness of the
stationary distribution at each rate (from the uniform corner and decline conditions) and a
positive floor under capital supply (from the gain condition, checked at the low end). This
assembles them.

The selection `ν` is built by choosing the unique stationary distribution at the CLAMPED rate, so
it is defined at every real number while agreeing with the intended one on the interval — the same
device `rateFamily` uses, and for the same reason. Uniqueness then gives both halves of what
`exists_equilibrium_of_selection` asks: that `ν r` is stationary, and that nothing else is.

`exists_equilibrium_of_technology` is the primitive statement: the technology `(A, δ)` is GIVEN,
and two inequalities on it — enough demand at `rlo` to clear the asset cap, little enough at `rhi`
to fall under the supply floor — deliver the equilibrium.
`exists_equilibrium_of_uniqueness_and_floor` is then the corollary in which the firm is chosen
last, by `exists_firm_of_bounds`, from the supply floor `m` and the asset cap.

/-- **An Aiyagari equilibrium with the technology GIVEN.** The firm is no longer chosen to fit
the household: any `(A, δ)` whose demand clears the asset cap at the bottom of the interval and
falls below the supply floor at the top produces an equilibrium inside it.

The two hypotheses are inequalities on the technology and nothing else — `le_capitalDemand_of_sq`
and `capitalDemand_le_of_sq` turn them into `4(rlo+δ)²·assetCap ≤ A²` and
`A² ≤ 4(rhi+δ)²·m`, which is the band `2(rlo+δ)√assetCap ≤ A ≤ 2(rhi+δ)√m`. Such an `A` exists
exactly when `(rlo+δ)√assetCap ≤ (rhi+δ)√m`, so the band is non-empty for small `δ` whenever the
household has a positive supply floor: that is the content of
`exists_equilibrium_of_uniqueness_and_floor`, which is now a corollary.

Note which bound is used where. The ceiling is the free one, `aggregateCapital_le`; only the floor
`m` is household work. -/

/-! ### Uniformity in the interest rate

The supply floor has to hold at every rate in the interval, and the gain condition is MONOTONE in
the rate: raising `r` raises `(1+r) t / (y₀ + (1+r) t)` towards one, so the right-hand side grows
while the left does not move. Checking the condition at the LOW end of the interval therefore
covers all of it. -/
