# CES with `γ < 1`: utility bounded below

`crra_pinch` showed that CRRA was confined to log: `tendsto_atBot_u` forced `γ ≥ 1`, and Light's
uniqueness condition forced `γ ≤ 1`. This file removes the first half of the pincer.

## What had to change, and where

The obstruction was never the axiom by itself. `tendsto_atBot_u` is what makes `extendBot u`
CONTINUOUS into `EReal`, and continuity of the reward is what Berge's maximum theorem runs on.
With `u (0⁺)` finite, `extendBot u` drops from a finite limit to `⊥` at zero consumption: not even
upper semicontinuous, so the maximum need not be attained. Deleting the axiom would have broken
`exists_optimal_action`, not weakened it.

`IncomeFluctuation` was therefore refactored over a utility DOMAIN, with `continuousOn_extendDom`
in place of `tendsto_atBot_u`. All that remains here is to take `dom = Ici 0` and check that CES
with `γ < 1` fits.

## Two things it costs

`continuousOn_extendDom` is discharged differently — `continuousOn_extendDom_Ici` below, where the
`⊥` branch is simply unreachable — and that part is free.

Positive consumption at the optimum is not. In the unbounded model it is a corollary of the reward
being `⊥` there. Here the reward at `c = 0` is `u 0`, a perfectly ordinary number, and the
household has to be shown not to want it. That is `MarginalInadaOn`: marginal utility explodes at
zero even though utility itself does not, and `positiveConsumption_of_marginalInada` turns it into
the `PositiveConsumption` the rest of the development asks for. Note that the condition has to
reach `c = 0` itself, which is why `MarginalInada` was generalised to a domain.

## What comes for free

Everything stated for `IncomeFluctuation`: the Bellman equation, uniqueness of the optimal action,
concavity and monotonicity of the value function, `policy_mono`, the Feller property, stationary
distributions, the Aiyagari equilibrium machinery. There is no second structure to carry them to.
