# CRRA utility, and where it fits

Two separate strands of the development each ask something of `u`, and this file specialises to
the CRRA family to see what they ask together.

* The income fluctuation structure requires `tendsto_atBot_u`: utility falls to `-∞` as
  consumption vanishes. That is what makes consumption positive at the optimum without a floor,
  and everything downstream — the policy, the distribution, the equilibrium — rests on it.
* Light (2018) requires relative risk aversion at most one, `RelativeRiskAversionLeOne`.

Within CRRA the first holds exactly when `γ ≥ 1` and the second exactly when `γ ≤ 1`, so
**together they hold only at `γ = 1`: log utility**. That is `crra_pinch`, the point of this file.

The pinch is sharp in both directions and neither side is an artefact of the proofs. For `γ < 1`
period utility is bounded below by zero, so it cannot tend to `-∞` under any argument
(`not_tendsto_atBot_crraUtility`); for `γ > 1` the utility is strictly CONCAVE in log consumption,
so `RelativeRiskAversionLeOne` fails as badly as it can
(`strictConcaveOn_crra_comp_exp`).

## What this says about the uniqueness programme

The formalisation's only worked witness, `NonVacuity.impatient`, uses `u c = -c⁻¹`, which is CRRA
with `γ = 2` (`crraUtility_two`). It satisfies the existence machinery and fails Light's
condition. Log utility is the one CRRA calibration where both can hold, and it sits on the
boundary of each — `u ∘ exp` is affine there, neither convex-strictly nor concave-strictly.

This is the parametric cost of the uniqueness argument stated exactly, and it matches what the
survey literature reports: Toda and Walsh (2024) call `RRA ≤ 1` "a quite strong parametric
restriction". Escaping `γ = 1` means giving up `tendsto_atBot_u`, which means carrying a
consumption floor or an Inada-free treatment of the corner — a different development, not a
different proof.

## The single derivative formula

`hasDerivAt_crraUtility` gives `u' c = c ^ (-γ)` for every `γ`, log included, since `log' c = c⁻¹`
is the `γ = 1` case. Monotonicity, strict concavity and the Inada condition are all read off it,
so the two branches of the definition are only ever separated once.

The pinch is not vacuous: `γ = 1` really is an income fluctuation problem. This is
`NonVacuity.impatient` with its `-c⁻¹` — which is `γ = 2` by `crraUtility_two` — replaced by log,
so the two witnesses sit on either side of Light's condition, and every utility axiom is now
discharged by a single lemma about the CRRA family. -/
