# The quantitative constants for CES

The equilibrium programme runs on four explicit constants: a lower bound on the secant slope of
`u` (which drives the corner condition and the precautionary gain), an upper bound on it (which
gives the value function its Lipschitz constant), a bound on saving (which gives the decline
condition), and the calibration arithmetic that checks they fit together. All four were computed
for `Real.log`, and `hu : P.u = Real.log` propagated through the whole chain.

This file does them for CES. The pleasant surprise is that most of it is not a duplication:
`hasDerivAt_crraUtility` already covers every `γ > 0`, log included, so the CES lemmas here
GENERALISE their log counterparts rather than sitting beside them. `crra_marginal_bound` at
`γ = 1` is `log_marginal_bound`, and `crraSlopeBound` at `γ = 1` is `2 log 2 / m`.

## The one place the shape changes

For log, marginal utility is `1/c`, so the slope bound available at resources `R` is `1/R` — it
DEGRADES as resources grow, and the multiplicative bound `c ≥ R / (1 + 2G)` is the right output.
For CES with `γ < 1` marginal utility is `c^{-γ}`, and on a capped problem `c ≤ maxConsumption`,
so there is a single slope `maxConsumption ^ (-γ)` that works everywhere. That turns the same
deviation argument into a UNIFORM bound on saving — `policy s ≤ K` for one constant `K` — which
is a cleaner route to the decline condition than the multiplicative bound, and the natural asset
bound falls straight out of it.

`policy_le_of_marginal_bound` is stated for any `u` with a uniform slope bound, so log gets the
uniform version too, with `m = 1 / maxConsumption`.

/-! ### Rational exponents reduce to integer powers

At `γ = 1 - 1/n` every exponent the CES constants produce is `m/n` for integers `m, n`, and a
comparison of `x ^ (m/n)` against a rational is equivalent to one of `x ^ m` against `c ^ n`.
These two lemmas are the whole bridge, and they are what keeps `γ` near 1 arithmetically
tractable: `norm_num` settles the integer form. -/

saving: the extra consumption is worth at least `m` per unit, and concavity of the continuation
caps what the forgone saving could have repaid at `deviationGap`, whatever the state.

The log development could not use this, because for log the available `m` at resources `R` is
`1 / R`, which is not uniform. It is stated generically anyway — log gets the version with
`m = 1 / maxConsumption`, which is uniform after all, just weaker than what the multiplicative
argument extracts. For CES with `γ < 1` the uniform `m = maxConsumption ^ (-γ)` is all there is,

`deviationGap = 2 β ‖V‖` is what the log development compares against, and it is not

constant `1 / (1-γ)`, so `‖V‖` blows up as `γ → 1` while the model it describes does not. Every
use of it is against a DIFFERENCE of continuation values, so what is really needed is the
oscillation, and that is `(u maxConsumption - u minIncome) / (1 - β)`. -/

/-! ### The sharp decline constant

`crra_policy_le` bounds saving by a constant, which is enough for a natural asset bound but far
too weak for the corner condition to meet it: the corner needs the threshold to be comparable to
the LOW income, and an absolute bound does not shrink with it. The log development gets a
PROPORTIONAL bound instead, `c ≥ R / (1 + 2G)`, whose decline threshold is proportional to income.

The CES analogue deviates to `θ` times the optimal saving rather than to half of it, and prices
the extra consumption at the margin where it lands: `b ≤ (β · oscGap / θ) · (c + (1-θ) b) ^ γ`.
Taking `θ` near 1 makes the right-hand side nearly `(β · oscGap) c ^ γ`, proportional to
consumption, which is the shape the decline condition needs. -/

/-! ### The asset cap never binds

`not_concaveOn_consumptionFn_of_cap_binds` makes Carroll and Kimball's conclusion FALSE wherever
saving reaches the cap, so the cap is the obstruction to Light's uniqueness argument, not the
utility class. It can be removed by calibration rather than by weakening the theory: run
`crra_policy_le_mul` by contradiction. If saving reached the cap then consumption would be at
most `maxIncome + (1 + r - θ) · assetCap`, and the saving bound evaluated THERE has to exceed
the cap.

The point of doing it this way is that the bound does not degrade as the cap grows -- the
right-hand side rises with `assetCap` while the left rises only through `oscGap` -- so raising
the cap always eventually works. A cruder estimate that keeps `maxConsumption ^ γ` on the left
grows on both sides and closes the window for `γ` near one, which is an artefact of the
estimate.

This is Marcet, Obiols-Homs and Weil (2007), Remark R4: "the upper bound on capital that was
introduced to obtain existence and uniqueness of the value function is, in fact, not binding".
Their route is different -- with endogenous labour supply, savings have an absorbing point `k̄`
below the bound, so the bound is slack for any initial condition below it -- but the purpose is
identical, and it is reassuring that the standard treatment regards the cap as an artefact to be
discharged rather than a modelling choice to be defended. -/
