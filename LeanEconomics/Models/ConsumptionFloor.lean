# A consumption floor from the margin, not from the level

`crra_pinch` traced the restriction `γ = 1` to `tendsto_atBot_u`, the requirement that utility
fall to `-∞` at zero consumption. This file replaces the use of that condition in the one place
where it does economic work — the uniform lower bound on consumption at the optimum — by a
condition on the MARGIN, which CRRA satisfies for every `γ > 0`, `γ < 1` included.

## Minimum income is necessary and not sufficient

A positive lower bound on income does not by itself keep consumption away from zero. It bounds
RESOURCES below, not consumption: `maxSaving = min assetCap resources`, so whenever the cap is
slack the household may save everything and consume nothing. Nothing about the income process
says it will not.

What minimum income does is make the CONTINUATION Lipschitz where the argument needs it. The
deviation argument compares the optimum with saving `h` less:

  `u (c + h) - u c ≤ β * (cont a - cont (a - h))`,

and the right-hand side has to be bounded by a multiple of `h`. The continuation is concave and
bounded, so its slope on `[0, x]` is at most `2‖V‖ / x` — which blows up as `x → 0`. Minimum
income kills that case: if consumption is small then saving is nearly all of resources, so
`a ≥ 3 minIncome / 4` and the slope constant is `4‖V‖ / minIncome`, depending on the state
through nothing at all. That is `contSlope_le`.

With a state-independent constant `L`, any consumption level whose marginal value beats `β L`
cannot be optimal, and `MarginalInada` supplies one. The floor is explicit:
`min δ (minIncome / 4)`.

## What this does NOT do, and why

The plan was to swap `tendsto_atBot_u` out of the structure. It cannot simply be swapped, and
the reason is worth recording. That condition does a SECOND job: `continuous_rewardFn` uses it
to make `extendBot u` continuous into `EReal`, and continuity of the reward is what Berge's
maximum theorem runs on. With `u (0⁺)` finite, `extendBot u` jumps from a finite limit down to
`⊥` at zero consumption — it is not even upper semicontinuous there, so the maximum is not
attained by the general argument and the whole `ExtendedStochasticProgram` apparatus lapses.

So admitting `γ < 1` needs the reward to stop being `extendBot u` and start being `u` itself,
real-valued and continuous on `[0, ∞)` — a different reward, hence a different structure, not a
different axiom. The floor proved here is what that structure will need and is stated so that it
transfers: it uses concavity and boundedness of the continuation and nothing else, and in
particular it never mentions `tendsto_atBot_u`.
