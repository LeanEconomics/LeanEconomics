# Consumption and savings with period utility unbounded below

Period utility may fall to `-∞` at zero consumption, which covers `σ ≥ 1` in the CES family
and log utility. Assets are capped.

## This file used to use a floor

It replaced `u` by `max floor u` to keep the reward real-valued and bounded, and then had
to prove the floor never binds: bounds on the value function above and below, then
`floor_lt_rewardFn_optimal`, then `cFloor_le_consumption_optimal`. Four structure fields
(`floor`, `cFloor`, `u_cFloor_le_floor`, `floor_lt`) and about a hundred and fifty lines of
proof existed only to establish that a device introduced for technical reasons was
invisible in the answer.

With `LeanEconomics.DynamicProgramming.Extended` the reward is simply `-∞` there. All of
that machinery is gone. What replaces it is a single hypothesis, `tendsto_atBot_u`, saying
utility falls to `-∞` at zero consumption -- which is not an extra assumption at all, since
it is precisely the situation that forced the floor.

**Positive consumption at the optimum now comes for free.** It used to be the conclusion of
the floor argument. Now it follows from the value function being real: if the optimal
action left zero consumption the reward would be `-∞`, so the value would be `-∞`, and it
is not. That is `exists_optimal_saving`, which returns `0 < consumption` as part of its
conclusion rather than requiring a separate development.

## What is unchanged

Consumption is still clamped *above*, and assets are still capped. Neither has anything to
do with `-∞`; both are the ordinary requirement that the reward be bounded above, which the
weighted theory addresses separately.

Cash on hand is now computed from `max 0 a` rather than `a`. With a floor, a state with
negative cash on hand received the floor value; without one it would receive `-∞`, which
the framework does not allow. Reading assets as nonnegative keeps the value finite
everywhere, and changes nothing on `[0, assetCap]`, which is where the results are stated.

/-! ### Concavity and the optimal policy

The `σ < 1` model gets concavity from the general criterion in
`LeanEconomics.DynamicProgramming.Bellman`. That criterion is stated for a real-valued
reward and does not apply here, because `ConcaveOn` over `EReal` would need an ordered
module structure that does not sit well. The way round is that the `-∞` never appears where
it matters: at an optimum consumption is strictly positive, so every value the argument
touches is finite, and the reasoning can be carried out in the reals. -/
