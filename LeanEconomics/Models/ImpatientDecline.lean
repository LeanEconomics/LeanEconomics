# Açıkgöz (2018) Proposition 4: the natural asset bound from impatience alone

`NaturalAssetBound` gets assets to decline from a LINEAR lower bound on consumption, which it
can supply only for log utility, and with the very lossy constant `exp (-2 β ‖V‖)`. Its own
docstring says what the sharp argument would need: "Getting it needs the Euler equation, hence
the envelope condition, hence the machinery that `IncomeFluctuationEnvelope` supplies only under
side conditions." That machinery now exists (`hasDerivAt_bellman`, `euler_ge`), and with it the
decline condition is not a calibration at all — it is exactly impatience.

## The argument, in one line

Let `z` be the income state at which consumption is LOWEST, and suppose the household does not
decumulate there: `A = g(a, z) ≥ a`. The Euler inequality from saving less is

  `u'(c(a, z)) ≤ β R · Σ_{z'} π_{z z'} u'(c(A, z'))`.

Consumption rises with assets and `A ≥ a`, so `c(A, z') ≥ c(a, z') ≥ c(a, z)`, and marginal
utility falls, so every term on the right is at most `u'(c(a, z))`. The weights sum to one.
Hence `u'(c(a,z)) ≤ β R · u'(c(a,z))`, and since marginal utility is positive, `1 ≤ β R`.

So `β R < 1` forces decline. No limits, no asymptotic marginal propensity to consume, no
calibration — and nothing is asked of the utility beyond a positive, decreasing derivative.

## What it costs

Only the Euler inequality's own side conditions: consumption positive at every optimum and the
saving strictly below its cap (`hslack`), which is `policyOf_lt_maxSaving` once the asset cap is
slack. Note the direction — `euler_ge` comes from the deviation "save LESS", so it needs room
BELOW, which is exactly what `A ≥ a > assetFloor` provides.

/-! ### Which income state consumes least

The Euler argument above runs at the state where consumption is lowest, and the Doeblin
construction wants a FIXED state to repeat. The two agree when income is iid: the continuation
is then the same function of saving whatever today's state, so the problem depends on the state
only through cash on hand, and `consumptionFn_mono` generalises from two asset levels at one
income state to two states with ordered resources. -/

/-- **Consumption rises with resources**, across income states as well as asset levels, whenever
the two states share a continuation. This is `consumptionFn_mono` with the state allowed to
move: its proof never used `z` for anything but `cont z`. -/

/-! ### The decline condition, from impatience

Putting the two together: with iid income the lowest-income state is the lowest-consumption
state, so the Euler argument runs there, and assets decline at it from EVERY asset level above
the borrowing constraint. That is the hypothesis `hdecl` of `exists_exhaust_of_decline`, which
every witness has been discharging by a numerical calibration. It is impatience.

What is NOT replaced is the corner condition `hzero`: decline alone gives a strictly falling
sequence, and the Doeblin argument needs an ATOM — the constraint has to be reached exactly, not
approached. That is a statement about the bottom of the state space, where the Euler equation
does not hold, and it stays a calibration. -/

/-- **Açıkgöz (2018) Proposition 4.** With iid income and `β(1+r) < 1`, assets strictly decline
at the lowest income state, at every asset level above the borrowing constraint. -/
