# The income fluctuation problem

The canonical incomplete-markets household: income follows a finite Markov chain, assets
earn interest, borrowing is ruled out, and the household chooses savings. The state is the
pair `(a, z)` of assets and income state, and

  `V (a, z) = max { u c + β * ∑ z', P z z' * V (a', z') }`.

Period utility may fall to `-∞` at zero consumption, so this covers log and CRRA with
`σ ≥ 1` -- and, since the utility DOMAIN is a field, CES with `γ < 1` as well.

## The domain field

`u` is required to behave on a set `dom` with `Ioi 0 ⊆ dom ⊆ Ici 0`, so there are exactly two
choices: `Ioi 0`, where utility is unbounded below, and `Ici 0`, where it is bounded there. The
old `tendsto_atBot_u` is replaced by `continuousOn_extendDom`, which says that `u` extended by
`⊥` off `dom` is continuous where consumption lives. That is what Berge actually consumes, and
it is exactly `tendsto_atBot_u` when `dom = Ioi 0` (see `continuousOn_extendDom_Ioi`) and merely
continuity of `u` on `Ici 0` in the other case, where the `⊥` branch is unreachable.

Nothing is lost by the swap: `tendsto_atBot_u` comes BACK as a theorem from `Unbounded`.

The one real consequence is that positive consumption at the optimum is no longer free. With
`dom = Ioi 0` the reward is `⊥` there and the value being real settles it; with `dom = Ici 0`
it has to be earned from a MARGINAL Inada condition instead — see `ConsumptionFloor`. Results
that need it take `PositiveConsumption` as a hypothesis, which both routes supply. Results that
only need `u` to behave take membership in `dom`, and carry over untouched.

## Retrofitted onto extended-real rewards

This file used a floor, with the same apparatus as the deterministic models: `floor`,
`cFloor`, and a chain of results establishing that the floor never binds. All of it is
gone. The reward is `-∞` where consumption vanishes, and positive consumption at the
optimum follows from the value function being real rather than from an argument.

The stochastic case needed `LeanEconomics.DynamicProgramming.ExtendedStochastic`, since the
continuation here is an expectation over shocks rather than `v` at a single point. That
turned out to be routine: the expectation is a sum of reals, so the objective is again an
extended real plus a finite coercion, and the reward's `-∞` never meets the expectation's
arithmetic.

## Unchanged

Discreteness of the income state is still what makes every function of `z` continuous, so
the budget correspondence is continuous in the pair. Consumption is still clamped above and
assets still capped -- the ordinary boundedness requirement, unrelated to the floor. Cash on
hand is computed from `max 0 a`, as in the deterministic retrofits, so that the value stays
finite at every state.

/-! ### Concavity and the optimal policy

The state is a pair `(assets, income state)`, which is not a module over `ℝ`, so concavity
is stated along the asset slice for each income state -- see
`LeanEconomics.Blackwell.forall_concaveOn_valueFunction`. Everything else follows the
deterministic argument, with the continuation value now an expectation: it is concave in
next period's assets because each `V (·, z')` is, and the transition probabilities are
nonnegative. -/
