# Consumption at the optimum is bounded away from zero

Positivity of optimal consumption is already known pointwise: a zero would make the reward
`⊥` and the value could not be real. What is needed for comparative statics is a UNIFORM
bound, a single `δ > 0` working at every state.

The bound proved here is explicit rather than compactness-based, and that is the whole point.
A compactness argument would say that optimal consumption is continuous and positive on a
compact state space, hence has a positive minimum — true, and recorded below as a sanity
check, but useless for the parametric problem. There the bound has to be uniform over an
interval of interest rates as well, and the corresponding compactness argument would need
joint continuity in `(r, s)`, which is precisely what the bound is wanted to prove. It would
be circular.

The explicit route avoids that. At the optimum the Bellman equation reads

  V s = u c* + β · E[V]

so `u c* ≥ -(1 + β)‖V‖`, a lower bound on the UTILITY of optimal consumption depending only
on the sup norm of the value function. Since `u` falls to `-∞` at zero, that pins consumption
away from zero. Nothing in the argument refers to the state, so the bound is automatically
uniform in the state; and when `r` varies, `‖V‖` is controlled by the reward bounds, which are
themselves uniform over a compact interval of rates.

This is the form that survives into a parametric statement. A family of programs sharing a

a common `L`, and then `exists_lower_bound_of_utility_ge` hands it a single `δ`. -/

/-! ### A choice set that does not move

The Bellman operator maximises over `Icc 0 (maxSaving s)`, an interval whose RIGHT ENDPOINT
moves with the interest rate. Comparing the operator at two rates therefore means comparing
suprema over two different sets, which is the awkward part of any such estimate.

Writing the choice as a fraction `θ ∈ [0,1]` of the maximum feasible saving removes the
problem: the choice set becomes `[0,1]` for every rate and every state, and all the rate
dependence moves into the objective, where it can be estimated pointwise. `|sSup f - sSup g|`
over a COMMON set is bounded by the pointwise gap; over two different sets it is not. -/

/-- **Consumption is bounded below by a quantity free of the state and the interest rate.**

Along the reparametrised choice, consumption is at least `minConsumption * (1 - θ)`. The bound
holds because the saving room never exceeds what is left after servicing the debt, so taking a
fraction `θ` of it leaves at least a fraction `1 - θ`.

This is the uniformity that makes the parametric estimate possible: it does not mention the
state, and the only model data it mentions -- `minConsumption` -- does not move with the interest
rate. Away from `θ = 1` the reward is therefore real and bounded, so the `-∞` cannot
interfere. -/
