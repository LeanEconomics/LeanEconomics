# Concavity of the consumption function as a closed class

`IncomeFluctuationConsumption` showed that concavity of the consumption function cannot follow
from concavity of `u` and of the value function, and that it is a statement about the FIXED
POINT. This file supplies the machinery that statements about the fixed point need, and reduces
Carroll and Kimball (1996) to its single inductive step.

The pattern is the one used four times already — monotonicity, concavity, Lipschitz bounds and
increasing differences — but with one new difficulty. Those four are properties OF the value
function, closed in sup norm by `isClosed_concaveOn` and its relatives. Concavity of the
consumption function is a property of the value function's ARGMAX, and nothing says offhand
that an argmax survives a uniform limit. So the closure step has to be proved rather than
quoted, and that is what `tendsto_policyOf` does: along a uniformly convergent sequence of
continuation values the optimal actions converge, because a cluster point of the maximisers is
a maximiser of the limit and the maximiser of the limit is unique.

That gives `concaveOn_consumptionFn_of_preserves`: if the Bellman operator carries a concave
consumption function to a concave consumption function, the fixed point's consumption function
is concave. The iteration starts from `0`, whose consumption function is `resources`, affine on
the asset region — `policyOf_zero`, an agent with no future eats everything.

## What is proved, and what is left

The hypothesis `hT` is the whole of Carroll and Kimball. Two thirds of it are now discharged.

**The analysis.** On paper the argument runs through second derivatives: risk tolerances ADD
across the optimisation, `T_V(m) = T_u(c) + T_W(m - c)`, and Kimball's risk-tolerance
aggregation theorem propagates `T_V' ≥ T_u'` from the continuation to the value. `PowerMean`
supplies the integrated form of exactly that, with no derivative: for CRRA marginal utility the
consumption paired with a given stock of end-of-period assets is a positive multiple of the
weighted power mean, exponent `-γ`, of next period's consumptions, and a power mean with a
NEGATIVE exponent is concave and nondecreasing. Homogeneity turns that into the convexity of a
sublevel set, which is elementary.

**The transfer.** Turning concavity of that map into concavity of the consumption function is
usually done by differentiating an inverse function. `concaveOn_of_egm` does it from the budget
identity alone: write the choice against end-of-period assets, and the two concavities are the
same statement.

**The Euler equation** `hEuler` is proved in `IncomeFluctuationEuler`: `hasDerivAt_bellman`
runs the Clausen and Strub sandwich along the ITERATES rather than at the fixed point,
`euler_of_interior` reads the first-order condition off it, and
`concaveOn_consumptionFnOf_bellman_of_interior` is this theorem with `hEuler` discharged.

**What is left is INTERIORITY.** The first-order condition needs the household to save strictly
inside the asset region and strictly below its feasible maximum, this period and next, and at
the borrowing limit it does not: `policy_eq_zero_of_corner_at` shows the constraint binds where
resources are small. Carroll and Kimball's conclusion survives the kink (the constrained branch
is affine with slope one, and it lies to the left, which is the direction concavity allows) but
the gluing is real work.

**Toda (2021) still bounds what can be hoped for.** Under regularity conditions HARA is
NECESSARY for the consumption function to be concave, and the structure assumes of `u` only
strict concavity, so `hT` at that generality is FALSE and no proof of it can exist. That is why
the step above is stated for CRRA, which is what Light's published version (2020) assumes.

## OWED: this is deferred, not abandoned

The obstruction has moved four times.

* HARA was the first answer: Toda (2021) makes it NECESSARY, and `Analysis/HARA.lean` supplies
  it. The utility class is no longer the blocker.
* The asset cap was the second, and worse, because it made the conclusion outright FALSE --
  `not_concaveOn_consumptionFn_of_cap_binds` below. `crra_policy_lt_assetCap` removes it by
  calibration, and `nearLog` is recalibrated so that saving provably never reaches the cap.
* Differentiability was the third, and it is now GONE: `hasDerivAt_bellman` is the Clausen and
  Strub sandwich run along the iteration, and `PowerMean` removes second derivatives altogether.
* The Euler equation was the fourth, and it is proved: `euler_of_interior`.

What remains is the borrowing-constraint kink, and nothing else.

So this file does not claim Carroll and Kimball. It claims the analysis behind it, and the
reduction of the remaining gap to interiority of the saving choice.

/-! ### The endogenous-gridpoint transfer

The step that carries concavity forward is not about the Bellman operator at all. Write the
household's choice against END-OF-PERIOD assets rather than against cash on hand: let `C A` be
the consumption it pairs with saving `A`, so that the budget reads `y + R a = A + C A`. The
graph of the consumption function is then the curve `A ↦ (A + C A, C A)`, and concavity of the
consumption function is exactly concavity of `C`.

That equivalence is elementary — it is proved below with no derivative and no inverse function,
from the budget identity and the fact that `A + C A` is strictly increasing. What it buys is
that the hard step moves to `C`, where the first-order condition makes it a POWER MEAN of next
period's consumptions, and `Analysis/PowerMean` settles those. -/

/-! ### Carroll and Kimball for CRRA, from the first-order condition

With CRRA marginal utility `u' c = c ^ (-γ)` the first-order condition says exactly that the
consumption paired with saving `A` is a positive multiple of the weighted power mean, exponent
`-γ`, of next period's consumptions at `A`. `Analysis/PowerMean` makes that map concave and
nondecreasing, and the transfer above does the rest. -/

Everything except `hEuler` is now proved: the power-mean concavity that Carroll and Kimball
obtain from Kimball's risk-tolerance aggregation, and the endogenous-gridpoint transfer that
turns it into concavity of the consumption function. `hEuler` is the first-order condition of
the maximisation, which holds wherever the choice is interior — see the module docstring. -/

/-! ### The asset cap obstructs concavity, and `hT` is stated too strongly

Attempting `hT` for log utility — the one CRRA specification this structure admits with Light's
condition, by `crra_pinch` — turns up an obstruction that has nothing to do with Carroll and
Kimball and everything to do with the cap.

Where the cap binds the household cannot save more, so every extra unit of resources is consumed
and the consumption function has slope exactly `1 + r`. Below, wherever it saves strictly more,
the slope is strictly less. Increments therefore RISE across the kink, which concavity forbids.
`not_concaveOn_consumptionFn_of_cap_binds` proves it.

So `hT` as stated is not merely hard, it is FALSE for any calibration whose cap binds, quite
apart from the HARA question. Concavity of the consumption function on the asset region needs the
cap to be SLACK — above the natural asset bound, so that the household never wants to save that
much. That is exactly what `exists_decline_of_consumption_lower_bound` is about, and by
`one_sub_mpc_mul_of_asymptotic` the condition behind it is `β (1 + r) < 1`.

Which ties the two halves of the development together: the imposed `assetCap`, so far a
bookkeeping device for compactness, has to be justified economically before the Carroll–Kimball
hypothesis can even be true. -/
