# The consumption function

`consumptionFn z a` is what the household actually eats at assets `a`: cash on hand less the
optimal saving. Light (2018) Theorem 1 needs three things from it — positivity, monotonicity,
and CONCAVITY in assets (his Lemma 4). The first two are proved here. The third is not, and
this file says exactly why.

## Consumption rises with assets

`consumptionFn_mono` is the theorem of this file, and it is the mirror image of `policy_mono`.
That one swapped the two households' savings and used increasing differences of `u`; this one
swaps them by the SAME resource gap, `b ↦ b + Δ` and `b' ↦ b' - Δ`, which leaves every
consumption level untouched and moves only the continuation. So the roles are exchanged: the
argument runs on increasing differences of the CONTINUATION, and it is again
`ConcaveOn.sub_le_sub_of_shift` — applied to `cont` rather than to `u`.

Together the two say the marginal propensities are both non-negative:

  `0 ≤ c(a') - c(a) ≤ resources(a') - resources(a)`   for `a ≤ a'`,

which is `sub_le_sub_of_le_resources`. Neither half needs a derivative.

## Concavity is NOT free, and this file does not prove it

It would be pleasant if concavity of `c` followed from concavity of `u` and of the value
function, the way monotonicity does. It does not. With CRRA `u` and a continuation of constant
absolute risk tolerance, the marginal propensity to consume is `T_u(c) / (T_u(c) + T_W(b))`
with `T_u(c) = c/γ` and `T_W` constant, which RISES with consumption — so the consumption
function is CONVEX. Concavity therefore cannot follow from concavity of the two primitives; it
needs the continuation to inherit the curvature of `u`, which is what makes it a statement
about the FIXED POINT rather than about one application of the operator.

That is the Carroll and Kimball (1996) theorem — the Bellman operator preserves concavity of
the consumption function when utility is HARA — and it is the shape of the closed-class
arguments already used here for monotonicity, concavity, Lipschitz bounds and increasing
differences. Light states it as his Lemma 4 and cites Jensen (2017) rather than proving it.
It is left as a hypothesis: `mul_marginal_le_of_scale` takes it as an argument, and everything
else that theorem needs about the consumption function is discharged here.

/-! ### A linear lower bound on consumption makes assets decline

Ma and Toda (2022) prove that the consumption function is asymptotically LINEAR whenever
marginal utility is regularly varying, and characterise the slope. Their Corollary 2.10 covers
this model — constant discount factor and return, bounded relative risk aversion, `R ≥ 1` — and
gives the asymptotic marginal propensity to consume in closed form,

  `c̄ = 1 - (β R^(1-γ))^(1/γ)`.

That result is about the UNCAPPED problem and is not proved here. What is proved here is the
consequence, which is what this development actually wants: a linear lower bound on consumption
forces assets to fall, above an explicit threshold. That is precisely the hypothesis `hdecl` of
`exists_exhaust_of_decline`, on which the whole Doeblin uniqueness and convergence argument
rests, and which has been a raw assumption until now.

The two fit together exactly. With Ma and Toda's slope the asymptotic growth factor of assets is
`(1 - c̄) R = (β R)^(1/γ)` — `one_sub_mpc_mul_of_asymptotic`, below — so the condition
`(1 - ε) (1 + r) < 1` demanded by `policy_lt_self_of_consumption_lower_bound` is exactly `β R < 1`.
Impatience, and nothing else, is what bounds assets. -/

/-- **The asymptotic growth factor of assets is `(β R)^(1/γ)`.** With Ma and Toda's asymptotic
MPC `c̄ = 1 - (β R^(1-γ))^(1/γ)`, the factor `(1 - c̄) R` by which assets grow collapses to
`(β R)^(1/γ)`, so assets are eventually contracted exactly when `β R < 1`. -/
