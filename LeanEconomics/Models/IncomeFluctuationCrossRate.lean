# Comparing two interest rates

Estimates relating two household problems that share an income process and an asset cap but
differ in the interest rate. These are the cross-rate ingredients of the sup-norm estimate on
the Bellman operator; they are stated for two programs rather than for a family, which is
more flexible and needs no indexing.

They are only expressible at all because `assetCap` is a structure PARAMETER: `P` and `Q`
below have the same type, so their state spaces and feasible sets are directly comparable.

## The trap

The obvious estimate is false as stated. Resources differ by

  resources_P s - resources_Q s = (P.interest - Q.interest) * max 0 s.1

which is UNBOUNDED in the state: a household with enormous assets sees an enormous change in
income from a small change in the rate. A sup-norm estimate over all states cannot come from
this quantity directly.

What rescues it is that the difference is only visible through a clamp. Maximum feasible
saving is `min assetCap resources`, so once resources exceed the cap at BOTH rates the
difference is exactly zero. The difference can be nonzero only where some rate leaves
resources below the cap, and that confines the state: `(1 + r) * max 0 s.1 < assetCap`. So
wherever the estimate is not trivially zero, the offending factor is bounded — by
`assetCap / (1 + rlo)`, with `rlo` any lower bound on the rates considered.

That is the shape every cross-rate estimate here takes: a case split on whether the clamp
binds, trivial on one side, and bounded on the other precisely because the clamp failing to
bind confines the state.

/-! ### The clamped consumption gap

Harder than the saving bound in two ways. The clamp LEVEL `maxConsumption` now moves with the
rate too, since it is `maxIncome + (1 + r) * assetCap - assetFloor`; and the chosen saving has
to be carried along, which is where the `θ` reparametrisation earns its place — with the choice
written as the borrowing limit plus a fraction of the saving room, the same `θ` can be fed to
both programs. -/

/-! ### Assembling: from pointwise bounds to a bound on the supremum

The sup-norm estimate compares two suprema, and the reparametrisation has already made them
suprema over the SAME set `[0,1]`. What remains is to get from a bound on the objectives to a
bound on their suprema.

A naive pointwise bound would not do, and the reason is worth stating. Where consumption is
tiny but positive, `u` of the two consumptions can differ by an arbitrary amount however close
the rates are, because `u` falls to `-∞`; so

  ∀ θ, objective_P θ ≤ objective_Q θ + ε

is FALSE. Those actions are dominated -- consuming almost nothing is far worse than the
always-available choice `θ = 0` -- so they cannot affect either supremum, but a pointwise
statement cannot see that.

The cutoff `L` is what encodes it. The hypothesis is only required at actions worth at least
`L`, and `L` is separately known to sit below the other program's supremum. Actions below `L`
are then bounded by `L` itself and need no comparison at all. In use, `L` will be the value of
`θ = 0`, which both programs have available. -/
