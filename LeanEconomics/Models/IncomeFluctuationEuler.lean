# The Euler equation along the iteration, and the borrowing limit

Carroll and Kimball's induction runs along the ITERATES `Tⁿ 0`, so everything it needs must hold
one step of the iteration at a time, and at states where the borrowing limit BINDS.

## The envelope condition

`hasDerivAt_bellman` is Clausen and Strub's theorem for `bellman v` rather than for the fixed
point. Nothing in the lazy-agent argument used the fixed point: freezing a feasible saving and
varying current assets gives a differentiable lower bound touching `bellman v` at the optimum,
and concavity of the slice supplies the upper half of the sandwich. `euler_of_interior` reads
the first-order condition off it.

## But the Euler equation does not need it

The same freezing trick gives BOTH one-sided bounds on the marginal value of assets — carry the
poorer household's plan forward (`bellman_sub_ge`), or the richer household's plan back
(`bellman_sub_le`) — and those are enough. Comparing the optimum with a deviation of size `ε`
and letting `ε` shrink gives

* `euler_le`, from saving MORE, which is feasible unless the household already saves the
  maximum, and
* `euler_ge`, from saving LESS, which is feasible unless the household is at the borrowing
  limit;

and `euler_eq` is the two together. No envelope theorem, no second derivative: only that `u` is
differentiable at the consumptions concerned.

## The borrowing limit

That asymmetry is the whole point. At the limit `euler_ge` fails and the first-order condition
degenerates to the inequality `euler_le`, which in endogenous-gridpoint form says consumption is
at most `egmMap` (`egmMap_ge`). `concaveOn_of_egm_corner` shows that is enough: at a constrained
state the saving is `assetFloor`, which lies below ANY average of savings, and that is the only
thing the transfer of `IncomeFluctuationCarrollKimball` ever needed. So the kink costs nothing,
and `concaveOn_consumptionFnOf_bellman` is Carroll and Kimball's induction step with the
borrowing limit allowed to bind anywhere.

What it still assumes is that the asset CAP is slack — a different condition, discharged by
calibration in `crra_policy_lt_assetCap` — and the induction hypotheses on the continuation's
consumption function.

/-! ### The Euler inequality, which survives the borrowing limit

Saving MORE is feasible whenever the household is not already saving the maximum, and that has
nothing to do with the borrowing limit. So this half of the first-order condition holds at the
corner too, and it is the half the concavity argument needs there. -/

/-- **The Euler inequality.** Marginal utility today is at least the discounted, interest-
augmented expected marginal utility tomorrow. The only interiority is `hAmax`: the household
could save a little more. -/

Where the constraint binds the Euler equation is only an inequality, and the endogenous-gridpoint
transfer has to absorb that. It does, and the reason is short: at a constrained state the saving
is `assetFloor`, which is below ANY average of savings, so the step the transfer needs is free
there. -/

function needs the Euler equation only where the borrowing limit is slack; at the limit the
inequality `hle` suffices, because the saving is then at its minimum. -/

proved, from the Clausen–Strub envelope run along the iteration. What is assumed instead is
interiority, which is a property of the state rather than of the model, and the reason the
statement is not yet unconditional. -/

/-- **Carroll and Kimball (1996), the induction step for CRRA, with the borrowing limit allowed
to BIND.** No interiority at the limit is assumed; the only slackness required is of the asset
CAP, which `crra_policy_lt_assetCap` discharges by calibration and which is a different
condition entirely.

Where the limit binds the Euler equation degenerates to an inequality, and `concaveOn_of_egm_corner`
absorbs that: the saving is then at its minimum, so it sits below any average of savings, which
is the only thing the transfer needs. -/
