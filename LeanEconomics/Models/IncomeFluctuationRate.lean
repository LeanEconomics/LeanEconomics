# Varying the interest rate

The cross-rate estimates so far take two programmes plus a hypothesis for each field they
must share -- income, maximum income, minimum income, the transition matrix, the discount
factor, the utility function. Six hypotheses is a signal that the wrong object is being
quantified over: in the comparative statics only the INTEREST RATE varies.

`withRate` makes that structural. Every field except `interest` is inherited, so every
sharing hypothesis becomes `rfl` and disappears from the statements, and
`fun r => P.withRate r _` is the family the equilibrium theorem wants.

The other content here is the step that turns the two argument gaps -- in consumption and in
the continuation value -- into a comparison of objectives. It is stated with the gaps as
hypotheses, so the analytic work (uniform continuity) and the arithmetic (extended reals)
stay separate.

/-! ### The sup-norm estimate

Everything assembled. Choosing the rate gap small enough makes the Bellman operator move by
less than any prescribed amount, uniformly over the region.

Three separate smallness requirements are imposed on the rate gap, and the `+ 1` in each
constant is only to keep the divisions safe when the asset cap is zero:

* the saving gap must fall under the continuation value's modulus,
* the consumption gap must fall under utility's modulus,
* the consumption gap must be at most `δ/2`, so that consumption at the SECOND rate stays
  positive given that the cutoff bounds it at the first. Without this the reward at the
  second rate could be `⊥` and the comparison would be vacuous.

Actions below the cutoff need no comparison at all: they are already worth less than
`loBound v`, which is itself below the other operator's value. -/

/-- **The value function moves continuously with the interest rate, on the region.**

Stated AT a reference rate rather than between two arbitrary rates, and that is not a
weakening -- it is what makes the argument work. The modulus produced by
`exists_rate_modulus` depends on the continuation value fed to the operator, so comparing two
moving rates would need the family of value functions to be equicontinuous. Fixing the
reference rate makes the continuation value a single fixed function, and continuity at every

/-! ### What policy continuity is for

The distribution side consumes the policy only through the Markov operator, and only through
its SUP norm: the closed-graph argument for `r ↦ μ r` needs

  ‖markovOp_r h - markovOp_r₀ h‖ → 0

because `∫ markovOp_r h dμ_r` splits into `∫ (markovOp_r h - markovOp_r₀ h) dμ_r`, bounded by
that norm, plus a term weak convergence handles. Pointwise convergence of the policy would
not do.

The lemma below is the interface: it reduces the operator gap to the gap in the SUCCESSOR
STATES, which is where the policy enters. Combined with uniform continuity of `h` on the
compact state space, uniform convergence of the policy is exactly what is needed, and
nothing more. -/
