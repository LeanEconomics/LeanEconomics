# Light (2018) Theorem 1: saving rises with the interest rate

This is the last link in the uniqueness chain. `CapitalSupplyMonotone` turns a uniformly larger
policy into larger aggregate capital (Theorem 2), and `Equilibrium.Uniqueness` turns monotone
capital supply into a unique equilibrium rate (Theorem 3). What is still needed is that the
policy IS uniformly larger at the higher rate, which is Theorem 1.

## The comparison is at a rescaled asset level

Light's device is that two problems at different rates share a budget set. Cash on hand at
`(a, R₁)` is `y + R₁ a`, and at `(t a, R₂)` with `t = R₁ / R₂` it is `y + R₂ t a = y + R₁ a` —
the same. The saving cap is the same too, being `min assetCap (cash on hand)`. So the two
maximisations run over the SAME interval with the SAME current-consumption map, and differ only
in the continuation.

That reduces the comparison to single crossing, and single crossing here is derivative-free.
`policy_le_of_cont_increasingDifferences` is the exchange argument of `policy_mono` run in the
other direction: there, one objective at two states; here, two objectives at one state. The
hypothesis is that the continuation has INCREASING DIFFERENCES across the two rates — the
integrated form of Light's `f'(·, R₂) ≥ f'(·, R₁)`, needing no derivative and closed under
pointwise limits.

The theorem then chains

  `g(a, R₁) ≤ g(t a, R₂) ≤ g(a, R₂)`,

the first step single crossing and the second `policy_mono`, since `t ≤ 1`.

## What is left, and that it is the SAME gap as Carroll–Kimball

The hypothesis `hid` is the property Light propagates through the operator, and propagating it
is his step 5. That step is not derivative-free and cannot be made so: it runs on the envelope
condition `(Tf)'(a, R) = R u'(σ_f(a, R))` as an EQUALITY, and the derivative-free substitute is a
sandwich between two utility increments which is strictly loose. The Clausen–Strub lemma in
`Analysis.DifferentiableSandwich` is exactly the statement that the sandwich closes only in the
derivative limit.

Worth recording precisely: his step 5 applies Lemma 3 to `σ_f(·, R₂)` and needs it CONCAVE. That
is Light's Lemma 4, which is the Carroll and Kimball theorem — the hypothesis `hT` of
`IncomeFluctuationCarrollKimball`. So the residual hypothesis here and the residual hypothesis
there are not two gaps but one: concavity of the consumption function, which by Toda (2021) is
unavailable outside HARA. Closing it closes both.

The pivotal inequality that step 5 turns on, `mul_marginal_le_of_scale`, is already proved.
