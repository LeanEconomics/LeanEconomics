# The contraction, run on the compact region alone

The value function is a bounded continuous function on all of `ℝ × Z`, but the model only
ever lives on `[0, assetCap] × Z`, which is forward invariant: every feasible choice lands
back in it (`feasible_subset_region`). So the Bellman operator evaluated at a state of the
region never consults the continuation value anywhere else.

That has a consequence worth exploiting. The whole contraction estimate can be run with
suprema taken over the REGION rather than globally:

  sup_region |V_P - V_Q| ≤ (1 - β)⁻¹ * sup_region |bellman_P V_Q - V_Q|

so comparative statics in the interest rate never needs a global sup-norm estimate. Since
the agent distribution also lives on the region, this is all the equilibrium argument
requires. It needs no second programme on the subtype, and no transport: it is a direct
estimate on the objects already built.

The mechanism is that the reward cancels. Two continuation values fed to the same programme
give objectives differing only in the discounted expectation, and the expectation samples
the next asset level, which feasibility confines to the region.

/-! ### The cutoff: actions worth keeping consume a bounded amount

The pointwise comparison the sup-norm estimate needs is false at actions that consume almost
nothing, because `u` falls to `-∞` there and two nearby rates can give utilities an arbitrary
distance apart. Such actions are dominated: saving nothing is always feasible and is worth at
least `loBound v = u minIncome - β‖v‖`, which the framework already places below the
supremum (`le_maxE`).

So it is enough to compare actions worth at least `loBound v`, and this section shows those
actions consume at least a fixed `δ > 0`. The `δ` depends on `u` and on `‖v‖` only — not on
the state and not on the interest rate, which is what the parametric argument needs. -/

/-- **Actions worth keeping consume a bounded amount**, for a cutoff `δ` given in advance.

Separating the choice of `δ` from its use is what makes the bound uniform across interest
rates: the hypothesis on `δ` mentions only `u`, `loBound v` and the discount factor, none of
which move with the rate, so a single `δ` serves every rate. -/

/-! ### Uniform continuity

The two moduli the sup-norm estimate consumes. Both are uniform in the state, which is what
matters; neither is uniform in the interest rate, and neither needs to be, since the rate
enters only through the ARGUMENTS fed to `u` and to the continuation value, and those gaps
are already controlled by the cross-rate lemmas.

Note `Z` carries only a discrete topology, with no metric, so `ℝ × Z` is not a metric space
and uniform continuity of the continuation value cannot be taken there directly. It is taken
in the asset coordinate for each income state separately and the finitely many moduli
combined, which is legitimate exactly because `Z` is a `Fintype`. -/

/-- **Uniform continuity of utility**, away from zero consumption. The interval is compact and
sits inside `Ioi 0`, where `u` is assumed continuous; the cutoff is what puts consumption
there. -/
