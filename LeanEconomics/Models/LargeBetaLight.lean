# Light's Theorem 1 at large `β`

`policy_mono_withRate_hara` — a household facing a higher rate saves at least as much — needs
the saving cap slack along BOTH iterations, and in particular for the higher-rate economy
choosing against the lower-rate economy's iterates. `Calibrated` supplies that from an oscillation
bound uniform in the rate, which at Aiyagari's `β = 0.96` is off by orders of magnitude.

This file supplies it from the minimal MPC instead, and the price is that the two rates have to
be CLOSE: within `1 - Þ₁` of each other, where `Þ₁ = (βR₁)^(1/γ)` is the patience factor at the
lower rate. That is not a defect of the estimate but of the comparison — a household facing a
much higher rate against an old continuation can save more than its own cap — and it costs
nothing, because monotonicity on overlapping short intervals is monotonicity on their union
(`monotoneOn_of_local`).

## The hybrid bound

Economy 2 choosing against economy 1's iterate `v` at assets `a` is economy 1 choosing against
`v` at `t a`, `t = R₁/R₂ ≤ 1` (`consumptionFnOf_withRate`). Consumption rises with assets, so
economy 2's consumption at `a` is at least economy 1's at `a` itself, which the minimal MPC bounds
by `κ₁ (y + R₁ a)`. Saving is then at most `(1-κ₁) y + (R₂ - κ₁ R₁) a`, and `R₂ - κ₁ R₁ = Þ₁ +
(r₂ - r₁)`: the coefficient on assets exceeds `Þ₁` by exactly the rate gap.
