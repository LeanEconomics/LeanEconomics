# A natural asset bound for log utility

`exists_decline_of_consumption_lower_bound` turns a LINEAR lower bound on consumption into the
statement that assets above an explicit threshold decline — the natural asset bound, which is
what `assetCap` has been standing in for, and what
`not_concaveOn_consumptionFn_of_cap_binds` says has to hold before the Carroll–Kimball
hypothesis is even true. Its input, the linear bound, has been missing. This file supplies it
for log utility.

## The argument is the crudest possible deviation

Saving nothing is always feasible. Comparing the optimum with it,

  `u (resources) + β · cont 0 ≤ u (consumption) + β · cont (policy)`,

so `u resources - u consumption ≤ β (cont (policy) - cont 0) ≤ 2 β ‖V‖`. For LOG utility that
reads `log (resources / consumption) ≤ 2 β ‖V‖`, which is a linear bound outright:

  `consumption ≥ exp (-2 β ‖V‖) · resources`.

## Why this works for log and for nothing else

The deviation is informative only because log is UNBOUNDED ABOVE, so `u resources` grows without
limit and drags `u consumption` up with it. With CRRA `γ > 1` utility is bounded above, the same
comparison gives only `c^(1-γ)` bounded, hence a constant floor and no linear bound at all — the
crude deviation says nothing about rich households. That is another face of the same split
`crra_pinch` found, and it is the case the structure leaves us with anyway.

## What is honest about the constant

`exp (-2 β ‖V‖)` is very lossy. The sharp constant is Ma and Toda's asymptotic MPC
`c̄ = 1 - (β R^(1-γ))^(1/γ)`, at which the decline condition becomes exactly `β R < 1`
(`one_sub_mpc_mul_of_asymptotic`). Getting it needs the Euler equation, hence the envelope
condition, hence the machinery that `IncomeFluctuationEnvelope` supplies only under side
conditions. So the bound proved here is qualitatively right and quantitatively weak: it
establishes a natural asset bound, but only for interest rates small relative to `exp (-2 β ‖V‖)`,
where the sharp argument would ask only for impatience.

/-! ### A better constant, from a smaller deviation

`log_consumption_linear_lower_bound` compares the optimum with saving NOTHING, which is a huge
deviation and costs an exponential: `ε = exp (-2 β ‖V‖)`. Comparing instead with saving a
FRACTION `θ` of the optimum costs only a ratio, and letting `θ` approach one turns the bound
polynomial:

  `consumption ≥ resources / (1 + 2 · 2 β ‖V‖)`.

No derivative is taken. The reason a near-zero deviation is affordable is that BOTH sides shrink
with `1 - θ`: the utility gain is `log (1 + (1-θ) b / c)`, and the continuation loss is bounded by
`2‖V‖ (1-θ) / θ` because concavity makes the slope of `cont` on `[θb, b]` no larger than its slope
on `[0, θb]`. The factor `(1-θ)` cancels, and what survives is the comparison of the two
constants.

`θ = (G + 1/2) / (1 + G)` is chosen so that `θ (1 + G) - G = 1/2` exactly, which is what makes the
final inequality `b ≤ 2 G c`.

The gain is small when `‖V‖` is small and large when it is not: at `G = 1.3` the two constants are
`0.27` and `0.28`, at `G = 5` they are `0.007` and `0.09`. Since `‖V‖` grows like `|log minIncome|`,
it is the dispersed calibrations — the ones the precautionary motive needs — where this matters.

/-! ### The other half of exhaustion: the corner, for log

`exists_decline_of_consumption_lower_bound` gives assets falling above a threshold. The ergodic
argument also needs the constraint to BIND below one — `policy = 0` on `[0, a₀]` at the bad income
state — and `policy_eq_zero_of_corner_at` supplies that from two explicit constants: a Lipschitz
bound `L` on the value function and a lower bound `m` on the secant slope of `u`, with `β L < m`.

Both are computable for log. The secant slope of `log` on `(0, R]` is at least `1/R`, from
`log x ≤ x - 1`. The Lipschitz constant is the fixed point of the operator's own estimate,
`L = K (1+r) / (1 - β(1+r))` with `K = slopeBound log minIncome = 2 log 2 / minIncome`, so `β L < m`
reads

  `resources · β · 2 log 2 (1+r) / (minIncome (1 - β(1+r)))  <  1`,

a condition on the state's resources alone. Since resources at the bad state are
`minIncome + (1+r) a`, it cuts out an interval of low assets — exactly what the ergodic argument
wants, and exactly why the condition has to be state-dependent rather than global. -/
