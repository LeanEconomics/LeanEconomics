# A closed interval with moving endpoints is a continuous correspondence

`x ↦ Set.Icc (f x) (g x)` is upper and lower hemicontinuous when `f` and `g` are
continuous. This is the hypothesis Berge's maximum theorem needs, and a budget set
`{a' | 0 ≤ a' ≤ m a}` is exactly of this shape, so these two lemmas are what let a
constrained consumption problem be posed as a dynamic program.

## Main results

* `LeanEconomics.upperHemicontinuous_Icc`
* `LeanEconomics.lowerHemicontinuous_Icc`

## The asymmetry in the hypotheses

Upper hemicontinuity needs no order hypothesis: where `g x < f x` the interval is empty,
and the empty set is contained in everything.

Lower hemicontinuity needs `f ≤ g` *everywhere*, not merely at the point in question, and
this is not a technicality. If `f x = g x` while `f x' > g x'` at nearby `x'`, then `Γ x`
is a single point and `Γ x'` is empty, so an open set meeting `Γ x` meets nothing nearby.
Lower hemicontinuity genuinely fails there. An interval that is allowed to collapse and
then vanish is not a continuous correspondence.
